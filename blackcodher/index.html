 <h1> <b> Haleema's Tech Journey </b> </h1>

 <p style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif;"> I've just begun my tech journey and I know I have so much to learn. I think the below list will help me get through everything</p>

 <ul> 
     <li> Commitment</li>
     <li> Curiosity</li>
     <li> Enthusiasm </li>
 </ul>

<p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">  The best piece of advice I've been given during this journey is to :<q>  <b> Be unafraid of failure and asking stupid questions</q>  </b></p>

<p> Since beginning my tech journey, this quote from <i> Vanessa Hurst </i>  has really inspired me throughout my journey </p>

<blockquote> <b> <i> “Feeling a little uncomfortable with your skills is a sign of learning, and continuous learning is what the tech industry thrives on! It’s important to seek out environments where you are supported, but where you have the chance to be uncomfortable and learn new things.” </i></b></blockquote>
